# Walkthrough: Phase A Quarantine Execution v1.1

I have successfully executed the Phase A Quarantine as per the `DIRECTIVE.md` and `TASKLIST.md`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Architecture & Policy Updates
- Verified `architecture.md` (Constitution v1.1) and `prps/core_architecture.md` match the specifications.
- Updated `.gitignore` to include `/artifacts/quarantine/` and ensured `workspaces/` is properly ignored.

### 2. Directory Hardening (Quarantine)
- Created `artifacts/quarantine/phase1_preexisting/`.
- Moved the following folders and files to quarantine:
  - `index/`
  - `logs/`
  - `modules/`
  - `skills/`
  - `telemetry/`
  - `vault/`
  - `workflows/`
  - `agents.md`

### 3. Verification & Evidence
- Updated `EVIDENCE_LOG.md` with the final directory state and `git status`.
- Captured a final system snapshot using `atg_multi_snap.zsh`.

## Verification Results

### Directory State (Root)
Only the allowed items remain at the root level:
- `core/`
- `.0luka/`
- `workspaces/`
- `artifacts/`
- `prps/`
- `catalog/`
- `.gitignore`
- `architecture.md`

### Git Status
The quarantine directory is successfully ignored.

![Final Snapshot Log](file:///Users/icmini/0luka/workspaces/ws_260123_172642_antigravity_phaseA_directive/EVIDENCE_LOG.md)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Monitor the system for any side effects of the quarantine.
- [ ] Determine if `agents.md` should be restored to root with specific annotations.
