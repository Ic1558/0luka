# Walkthrough: Governance Upgrade (v0.5.0) & Legacy Quarantine

**Date**: 2026-01-26
**Agent**: Antigravity (gmx)

## 1. Governance Request GR-001 (Executed)
We upgraded the sealed system from **v0.4.1** to **v0.5.0** to support the **MCP Hand** architecture without violating the "No Code Changes" rule.

**Changes:**
- **Daemon**: `ops/governance/gate_runnerd.py` updated to support `authorize(action, args)` command.
- **Policy**: `core/governance/ontology.yaml` updated with `ACTION_TABLE` expansion for MCP tools.
- **Verification**: `ops/governance/verify_v050.py` created and passed.

**Evidence:**
- [x] `gate_runnerd.py` version string: `0.5.0`
- [x] Beacon Login: `authorize:action.followup.generate` observed in `global_beacon.jsonl`.
- [x] Handover Artifact: `Handover_OnePager_v050.md` sealed.

## 2. Module v1.0 Foundation
We established the **MCP Hand** (`plugins/executors/mcp_exec.py`) as the single authorized executor for tool modules.

**Architecture:**
Task (JSON) -> Hand (`mcp_exec.py`) -> Auth (`gate_runnerd`) -> Allowlist (`ACTION_TABLE`) -> Tool (`*.zsh`) -> Beacon (`global_beacon.jsonl`).

**Verified Flow:**
- `action.followup.generate` ran successfully via the Hand.

## 3. Legacy Quarantine (Stop Bleeding)
We aggressively silenced legacy noise that threatened system stability via `stop_bleeding_final.zsh`.

**Quarantined Agents:**
- `com.02luka.mls.ledger.monitor` (Missing script)
- `com.02luka.shell-watcher` (Legacy 02luka ref)
- `com.02luka.mary-dispatch` (Ghost)
- `com.02luka.atg_runner` (Confirmed Broken)

## 4. Known Issues (for next session)
- **Liam Engine Spam**: `liam_engine_worker.py` not found error persists in logs (though stub exists). Caller identified as likely hidden in `com.02luka.gg_session_worker` or similar complex legacy chain.
- **Maintenance Mode**: System is sealed. Any further changes require GR-002.

**Final Status**: **Green (v0.5.0 Certified)** with Legacy Noise significantly reduced.
