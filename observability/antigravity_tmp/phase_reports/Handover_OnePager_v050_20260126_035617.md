# Phase I: Final Handover Statement (v0.5.0)

The **0luka Governance System v0.5.0** is hereby **HANDED OVER** (Upgraded from v0.4.1 per GR-001).

## Release Anchor (Git Sealed)
- **Tag**: `v0.5.0`
- **Previous Tag**: `v0.4.1`

## Acceptance Conditions (Verified True)
- [x] **Golden Script**: `ops/governance/handover_v050.zsh` completes Start → Verify → Audit → Stop successfully.
- [x] **Verification**: `ops/governance/verify_v050.py` returns PASS (Includes `authorize` test).
- [x] **MCP Hand**: `mcp_exec.py` successfully authorizes and executes allowed tools.
- [x] **Runtime Log Hygiene (Bounded)**: Within the certification window, **no recurring `JSONDecodeError`** was observed.

## Scope Certified
- `ops/governance/gate_runnerd.py` (Judicial Daemon v0.5.0):
    - **Owner-only connections** (macOS `getpeereid` + `ctypes` fallback).
    - **4-byte big-endian framing** + 1MB cap.
    - **Startup sealing** of handlers & policy.
    - **Forensics chained** into `global_beacon.jsonl`.
    - **New**: `authorize(action, args)` command with beacon logging.
    - **New**: Expanded `ACTION_TABLE` for MCP Hand tools.

## Explicitly Not in Scope (Non-blocking failures)
- Legacy bridge daemons (`clc_wo_bridge_daemon.py`) → repeated ENOENT.
- experimental watchers / legacy cron jobs.

## Maintenance Mode
This repo is in **Maintenance Mode** for v0.5.0 certification scope. No further code changes affecting governance certification occur without a new Governance Request and a new sealed tag.
