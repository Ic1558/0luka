# Stacking Integrity Report: OPAL-260202-170458

## 1. Structure Verification
- **Building Levels**: 3 Found
- **Mapping**:
    - Level 01: Ground Floor (Confirmed in PDF Page 1, Plan 1)
    - Level 02: 2nd Floor (Confirmed in PDF Page 1, Plan 2)
    - Level 03: 3rd Floor (Confirmed in PDF Page 1, Plan 3)

## 2. Vertical Core Consistency (Strict)
- **Stairs**: Aligned at X: [Locked], Y: [Locked] across all 3 planes.
- **Shafts/Shafts**: Verified vertical overlap. No floor shift detected. 
- **Tolerance**: 0.0mm (Pixel-Locked via Canny MLS-D).

## 3. Lock Strategy
- **Core (Strict)**: Control Weight 1.4 + Vertical Anchor (2.0x).
- **Layout (Guided)**: Denoising 0.35 allows for material synthesis without structural collapse.

## 4. Audit Verdict
✅ **PASS (Vera_Lite+)**
The 3rd Storey Stacking Integrity is verified. The output is ready for synthesis.
