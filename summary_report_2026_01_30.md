# 0luka Project Reconciliation & Status Report
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Structural Law Violations (Verified)

## 1. Executive Summary
This report reconciles previous analysis with the authoritative `0luka_deep_scan_20260130.md` and verified codebase state. The project is in a state of **Structural Transition**. The governance logic ("Police") exists but is misplaced in `core_brain/`, while the root directory is cluttered with legacy artifacts in violation of the PRPS. A defined `migration_map.md` exists but has not been executed.

## 2. Verified Violations (Law vs. Reality)

### 🚨 Violation 1: Root Hygiene (The "Banned" Directories)
*   **Law:** `PRPS` (Section 2) allows only `core/`, `runtime/`, `ops/`, `observability/`.
*   **Reality:** The root contains `g/`, `tools/`, `system/`, `artifacts/`, `core_brain/`, `prps/`, etc.
*   **Gate Check:** The script `core_brain/ops/governance/gates/00_root_allowlist_check` confirms these are violations.

### 🚨 Violation 2: Governance Split & Misplacement
*   **Law:** `PRPS` places enforcement in `ops/governance/`.
*   **Reality:** Enforcement logic resides in `core_brain/ops/governance/`. The root `ops/` directory is nearly empty.
*   **Risk:** This split creates confusion over the "Source of Truth" for policy enforcement.

## 3. Corrected Findings (Reconciling previous errors)

*   **Governance Gates:** originally reported as "missing". **Correction:** They exist in `core_brain/ops/governance/gates/`.
*   **`core/doe` Status:** originally reported as "empty". **Correction:** Contains structure (`compiler`, `execution`, `orchestrator`), though implementation depth varies.
*   **Data Swamps:** `artifacts/` and `observability/` contain ~9,383 files. This is a verified maintenance issue.

## 4. The Path Forward (Aligned with `migration_map.md`)

The project has a defined plan in `core_brain/ops/governance/migration_map.md` that addresses the root violations.

### Phase 1: Execution of Migration (Immediate)
Execute the moves defined in the migration map to reach PRPS compliance:
1.  **Delete** `g/` (Legacy).
2.  **Move** `tools/` → `ops/tools/`.
3.  **Move** `artifacts/` → `observability/artifacts/`.
4.  **Move** `logs/` → `observability/logs/`.
5.  **Move** `config/` → `core/config/`.
6.  **Move** `system/`, `mcp/`, `workspaces/` → `runtime/`.

### Phase 2: Governance Consolidation
1.  **Migrate** `core_brain/ops/governance` → `ops/governance` to match PRPS.
2.  **Establish SSOT:** Resolve the `core/governance` vs `core_brain/governance` duplication by designating `core/governance` as the single Source of Truth.

### Phase 3: Core Hardening
1.  **Fix Router:** Update `core/router.py` to use dynamic paths and reference the new artifact locations.
2.  **Activate Gates:** Ensure `ops/governance/gates/00_root_allowlist_check` runs on every commit/task.
