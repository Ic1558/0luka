# Task: 0luka Phase 9 Governance & NLP Control Plane

## Status
- [x] **Discovery**: Audited Phase 2 and 2.1 implementation and verified behavior on branch `main`.
- [x] **Phase 8 (Dispatcher Service)**: Verified as PROVEN (Behavioral proof of reboot survival and activity logging).
- [x] **Phase 9 Spec**: Authored `modules/nlp_control_plane/PHASE9_SPEC.md` and `VECTORS.md`.
- [x] **Phase 9 Implementation**: Skeleton `synthesizer.py` implemented with mandatory Governance & Provenance gates.
- [x] **Phase 9 Verification**: `prove_phase9_nlp.py` PASS with deterministic vectors.

## Active Phase
- **Phase 9**: IN_PROGRESS (Linguist & Sentry logic reinforcement)

## Governance & Policy
- **Branch Protection**: Enforced through `policy.verified` and `execution.verified` events.
- **Fail-Closed**: Proven via `CLECExecutor` evidence enforcement.

## Next Steps
- Finalize NLP Model integration for complex conversion.
- Unblock Mission Control UI integration.
