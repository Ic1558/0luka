# How OPAL Became an OS-Grade Kernel

**Status:** Non-Authoritative (Philosophy/Manifesto)
**Rule:** This document does NOT override the Kernel Constitution.

## TL;DR

OPAL did not become OS-grade because:
- We wrote great code.
- We used a lot of AI.
- We made a fast worker.

It became OS-grade because:
**We slowed down to create "Law" that no one dared to break.**

- **Kernel** was locked.
- **ABI** was elevated to Law.
- **Engine** was demoted to Plugin.
- **Client** was forced to obey the Contract.

This is the point where a system changes type from **Application** → **Platform**.
