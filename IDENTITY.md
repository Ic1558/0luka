# SYSTEM ROOT — 0luka

This directory (`~/0luka`) is the **canonical governance and truth root** for the system.

## Authority
- **Governance**: Source of Truth (SOT) for policies and agents.
- **Operations**: Root for `run_tool.zsh`, `save.sh`, and `truth sync`.
- **Tooling**: Base path for `atg_multi_snap.zsh` and other Raycast scripts.

## Identity Rule
All agents (Lisa, Opencode) MUST treat this directory as the project root.
Legacy references to `~/02luka` must be considered deprecated and actively migrated.
