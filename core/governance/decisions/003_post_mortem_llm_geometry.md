# Post-Mortem: Decommissioning LLM-First Design Lane (Phase 2)

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** FINAL
**Decision:** DECOMMISSIONED

## 1. The Incident
Attempted to use Google Gemini (Multimodal LLM) to generate "Engineering-Grade" architectural visualizations directly from a text prompt and a hidden OBJ context.
**Result:** Generated images were aesthetically pleasing but geometrically invalid. The model "hallucinated" rooms, ignored scale constraints (3m walls), and failed to align with the `massing_v1.obj` source of truth.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis
The failure is not a bug, but a fundamental mismatch in model architecture:
1.  **Non-Verifiable Geometry:** DALL-E/Gemini/Midjourney are *Image Synthesis* models. They predict pixel probability, not vertex topology. They have no concept of "strict" geometry.
2.  **Boundary Violation:** The workflow violated the **BOUNDARY_MANIFESTO** by asking the AI to *interpret* scale ("walls precisely 3m") and *construct* geometry from text, effectively asking the AI to be the "Architect" rather than the "Painter".
3.  **Token vs. Tensor:** We tried to control spatial precision (Tensor/OBJ) using linguistic tokens (Prompt). This is a "lossy" translation that inevitably leads to drift.

## 3. Strategic Pivot (Phase 3.1)
We are immediately decommissioning the `UniversalDistiller` -> `Opal (Generative)` pipeline for geometry Tasks.

**The New Path: Geometry-First + Cloud-as-Painter**
1.  **Source of Truth:** `massing_v1.obj` (Generated by Python/Shapely) remains the absolute law.
2.  **Rendering Engine:** We will transition to a deterministic renderer (Blender/Three.js/SketchUp) that accepts OBJ/GLB natively.
3.  **AI Role:** AI will be demoted to "Surface Stylist":
    - Suggesting PBR Materials.
    - Generating Texture Maps (normals, roughness).
    - Setting Lighting HDRIs.
    - **Crucially:** AI never touches the mesh topology.

## 4. Immediate Actions
- [x] Document decision (This file).
- [ ] Remove `UniversalDistiller` from the critical automation path.
- [ ] Refactor `automation.py` to output "Clean OBJ" as the final artifact.
- [ ] Begin Phase 3.1 implementation (Blender/Texture Pipeline).

*"Geometry is Law. AI is Decor."*
