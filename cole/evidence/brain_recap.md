# Cole Brain Recap (Persistent)

This file is Cole's persistent working memory.

## Operating Law

- Default mode: Free Mode.
- System/core mutation allowed only with `COLE:TRACKED:` + allowed_files + objective/DoD + tk_id/run_id.

## Current System Understanding (High Level)

- Governance SOT for agents: `core_brain/governance/agents.md`.
- Bridge enforcement: `tools/bridge/consumer.py` enforces identity match (author <-> call_sign) and risk/lane routing.
- Mirrors/metadata: `0luka.md`, `core_brain/governance/router.md`.

## Session Notes

- Update this section when you ask me to preserve decisions, constraints, or long-run context.
